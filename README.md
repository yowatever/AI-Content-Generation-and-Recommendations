## Setup
Clone the repository:
```bash

git clone https://github.com/yowatever/AI-Content-Generation-and-Recommendations
```
Install required dependencies:
```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the indexing script to preprocess and index content:
```bash
python indexer.py
```
Start the application:
```bash
python app.py
```

## How It Works

Content Preprocessing: Raw data is ingested, cleaned, and indexed using FAISS for semantic search.

Query Handling: User inputs are processed with RAG, retrieving relevant content and using LLMs for enhanced response generation.

Recommendations: Based on historical data and user preferences, the system provides personalized suggestions.
